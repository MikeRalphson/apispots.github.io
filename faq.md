# API Spots FAQ

## What is this?

The API Spots is an open-source collection of tools for discovering,
exploring and interacting with APIs.  One of the main goals of the
project is to enable non-technical audiences to onboard, understand
and use APIs.  [Read the introduction]({{site.url}}/docs/intro) for more information.

## How do I use it?

The tools are bundled as a Chrome browse extension so all you need
is to have Chrome installed.  Click on the link below that
will take you to the Chrome Web store and add the extension.
