# Introduction

The *API Spots* project is an open-source collection of tools for
discovering, exploring and interacting with Application Programming
Interface (API) definitions.

The project aims to become the bridge that will
help onboard any type of user to the world of APIs,
without the need of a technical background.

## Installation

The API Spots collection of tools is distributed as a Chrome browser extension and you
can download it directly from the [Chrome Web Store]({{site.extension.download-url}}){:target="_blank"}.

<a class="huge fluid ui button" href="{{site.extension.download-url}}" target="_blank"><i class="download icon"></i> Download the Chrome extension</a>

After the extension has been successfully installed, a blue icon will be added on the Chrome toolbar.
Clicking on it will open a new browser tab and the **Open APIs** section will be displayed.
